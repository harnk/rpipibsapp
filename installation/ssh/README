This folder contains the rsa keys for ssh access.

Concept: The local machine keeps the private key.  A public key is 
put on machines that we want to access without a password.  In our
case, we want to pull a remote git repo without having to enter a 
password.  So we put the public key on a server under a particular
user who has restricted permissions on the machine.

id_rsa: private key
# keep on local machine: /home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa
# change permissions
chmod 0600 /home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa
# Enabling pi@pi keys
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add /home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa

id_rsa.pub: public key 
# put on any machine that you want to access without a password.
# On the other machine, put public key in .ssh/known_hosts:
cat id_rsa.pub >> /home/<user>/.ssh/known_hosts
